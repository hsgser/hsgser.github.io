Hi, I'm a CS Ph.D. student at UCLA under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://baharanm.github.io/">Baharan Mirzasoleiman</a>. My research is centered on developing efficient and robust machine-learning algorithms for large-scale datasets and architectures. Specifically, I'm working on improving the training efficiency of large language models and enhancing their robustness. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring Generative AI and Multimodal Learning, with a particular emphasis on improving data quality.

Before joining UCLA, I was an AI Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>. Prior to that, I received my BS degree, summa cum laude, from Toyo University. Going further back in time, I was a graduate of High School for Gifted Students (Hanoi University of Science) and a Maths Olympian (silver medal, IMO 2015).
